1. Problem
Sort a list of groceries and their cost by different parameters, print them to console and get the total price.

2. Solution Description
Sort groceryitem objects into a linkedlist that is compatible with GroceryListTester.

3. Problems Encountered
Originally the driver program was printing out the objects memory address instead of the instance variables I wanted it too,
I looked it up and eventually realized the @Ovveride tag could be used to allow the object to be printed without having to call .toString

4.
The linked list allows dynamic sizing, I'm able to add and remove objects as I please and I don't have to create a list of a known size.

5.
Inefficient and more memory intensive, not always the most effective route but very helpful for most use cases.

6. 
The programmer forgets to point to the link so there's no way for it to find the next item in the list therefore it won't iterate through all items

7. 
It doesn't touch the list as it exists it replaces the head effectivley destroying the list instead of linking it in.

8.
Doesn't actually touch the first node it only assigns it to a temporary pointer.

9. 
The programmer accidentally removes the pointer before being sure that it's the last node, that's why it leads to a nullpointerexception because you already killed the node.

10. 
You're checking if temp.link is null instead of if the temp value is null, the last index doesn't have a link so it skips multiplying the last index.
