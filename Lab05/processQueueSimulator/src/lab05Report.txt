1. Problem
Run a list of processes in order and show their completion time.

2. Solution Description
Have multiple classes interact create objects sort them into lists then run those lists in queue.


3. Problems encountered
I had trouble implementing the queue and linked list into the same class but with a little manipulation i relaized their functionality is really similar

4. How is a queue structured? (10pts)
First in first out, everything is in order.

5. Describe when it is most appropriate to use a Queue in a problem. (10pts)
When things need to be executed in a specific order.

6. Detail two ways Queues are commonly used in computing. (10pts)
Stuff like print jobs and searching that need to happen in order

7. What are the values in the queue following these actions? The answer must clearly show the “head” and “tail” values. (10pts)
Head: 5
Tail: 22
Values: [5, 25, 35, 45, 55, 22]

8.
Head: 3 k
Tail: 6 a
Array: m, e, j, k, n, o, a, b, c


9.
I dont know exactly how the queue class is coded but it looks like you should be using a peek method to access the data instead of queue[i]

10. 
were setting head to head.link instead of the temp value which is messing up our search
