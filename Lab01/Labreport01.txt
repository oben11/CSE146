1. Problem
Sort words by the number of consantants, vowels and length.

2. Solution Description
Transform each word string to a new word object, an object that stores the number of consantants, vowels and it's length.
Then solve by implementing a bubbleSort method for each sorting mode.

3. Problems Encountered
Originally I tried to do this without objects and only operate on the String arrays, this caused all sorts of weird errors
and some memory leaks to ultimatley objects were the way to go. They made the code less complex and simpler to understand.

4. What are the advantages of using an array?
Very simple, less complex and less memory usage.

5. What are the disadvantages of using an array?
Not dynamic, can't adjust the length.

6. Describe the range of valid indices for an array.
The number of valid indices is the number of indices you initialize it with. If you give it 10 indicies you can access indicies 0 -> 9.

7. 
No errors, outputs:
z
v
r
n
j
f
b

8. 
Incorrect loop initilization, loop will not run, use for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++).
9.
You need to create a for loop that copies the array element by element instead of just setting it equal to another array.
10.
It will create a double[] with the first 5 numbers being assigned on index's 0 -> 4 
and the first 5 numbers multiplied by 2.0 on index's 5 -> 9
