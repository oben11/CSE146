4. The JVM garbage collects unreachable objects. 
5. Linked lists allow dynamic size and efficient insertions/deletions, but arrays offer faster random access. 
6. Doubly linked lists enable bidirectional traversal, but require more memory than singly linked lists.
7. Lacks a loop for traversal needs correction to print "Abc efG Hil kLm nop".
8. Flawed logic for comparing lengths fails to return "efG".
9. Incorrectly updates node data needs fixing to yield "value efG Hil kLm nop".
10. Ineffective removal code requires head pointer change for an empty list.
