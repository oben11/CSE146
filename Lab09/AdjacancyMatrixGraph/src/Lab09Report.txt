1. Problem
The problem is to understand and apply depth-first search(DFS) and breadth first search (BFS) on a directed graph.

2. Solution Description
My code solves the problem by creating DFS and BFS algorithms that visit each node in a a specific order based on a graph structure

3. Problems Encountered
handling visited nodes properly and getting to the next node and stopping duplicates

4. DFS Description
DFS will search as far as possible along every branch before continuing using recursion.

5. BFS Description
BFS explores all of the neighbors for each depth before moving to the next level using a queue

6. Adjacency Matrix :

    V1   V2  V3  V4  V5  V6  V7
V1   0   1   0   0   0   0   0
V2   0   0   0   1   1   0   0
V3   1   0   0   0   0   0   0
V4   0   0   0   0   0   0   1
V5   1   0   1   0   0   0   0
V6   0   0   0   0   1   0   0
V7   0   0   0   0   0   1   0

7. DFS from v5
v5 > v1 > v2 > v4 > v7 > v6 > v3


8. BFS  from v5
v5 > v1 > v3 > v2 > v4 > v7 > v6

9. DFS from  v2
v2 > v4 > v7 > v6 > v5 > v1 > v3

10. BFS from v2
v2 > v4 > v5 > v7 > v1 > v6 > v3
