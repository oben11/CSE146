1. Problem
This lab is about working with binary search trees, and sorting fruit objects into them
2. Solution Description
The code creates and manipulates a binary search tree. making sure the tree stays balanced. The tester loads a file of fruit objects and populates the tree to make sure it works.

3. Problems Encountered
I ran into issues with getting the tree to balance correctly, i didnt implement it correctly Also had some trouble with search functions returning the right values

4. Self-Balancing vs. Non-Self-Balancing Trees
A self balancing tree automatically adjusts structure to maintain a height, non self balancing tree can cause slow performance because it doesn't have a maintained heingt

5. Big O for Balanced BST Search
O(log n)

6. Big O for Non-Balanced BST Search
O(n)
