1. Problem
Take a file, read it and parse it line by line, perform String or math operations on the contents of each line.

2. Solution Description
use FileIO to import files, use the printwriter java method to write the output to an output file.

3. Problems Encountered
I couldn't figure out how to get the program to ignore invalid lines or not fail if an incorrect file is entered, I learned to use try catch methods
which helped greatly for handling errors outside of my control.

4. Describe the difference between absolute and relative file paths
Absolute = full path to file, static and does not change
Relative = depends on where you're running the program, usually used to reference the programs home directory or a path in relation to the file

5. In terms of file paths, what does “./” mean?
Home directory in relation to program.

6. In this course, where should all files that are to be read from or printed to be placed?
in "./" so it will work in any file environment.


7. What important detail must one do when finished either reading from or writing to a file? (10pts)
you need close the file using .close()


8. Describe the purpose of “delimiters / separators” used in file formats. (10pts)
It creates boundaries that make it possible to systematically split lines into different elements


9.
Programmer incorrectly used filescanner.next() instead of filescanner.nextLine()
10.
File writer will only append if you give it a true argument, this should fix the issue
